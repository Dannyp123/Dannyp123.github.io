        This project is my Base Camp final. It is a newest version of my preexisting Dunn's Country Store page. I added a backend to allow people to reserve tablels in the store. I used Django's Registration and Login/logout features. I also used Send Grids API to send pregenerated emails to users, and Google Maps API to show a Google Maps view of the location.

              This independent application is a Django, full stack application. It shows off cars for sale and the details for each. The goal of this application was to get more independent work under my belt, and I want to dedicate more time to development outside of school.
